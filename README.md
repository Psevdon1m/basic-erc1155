## About ERC1155

The ERC1155 standard is a token standard for multiple types of tokens within a single contract. It allows for the creation and management of multiple token types, each with their own balances and metadata.

This contract is based on code originally developed by Enjin and has been modified to adhere to the ERC1155 standard.

## Usage

The contract provides functions to interact with the tokens, including:

- `balanceOf`: Get the balance of a specific token for an address.
- `balanceOfBatch`: Get the balances of multiple tokens for multiple addresses.
- `setApprovalForAll`: Approve an operator to manage all tokens for a specific address.
- `isApprovedForAll`: Check if an operator is approved to manage all tokens for a specific address.
- `safeTransferFrom`: Transfer a specific amount of a token from one address to another.
- `safeBatchTransferFrom`: Transfer multiple tokens from one address to another.
- `_mint`: Create a new token and assign it to an address.
- `_mintBatch`: Create multiple tokens and assign them to an address.
- `_burn`: Destroy a specific amount of a token owned by an address.
- `_burnBatch`: Destroy multiple tokens owned by an address.

Please refer to the contract source code for detailed information on each function.
